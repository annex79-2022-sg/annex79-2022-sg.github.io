        The 9th expert meeting of IEA EBC Annex-79 meeting and 22nd International Symposium on Occupant Behavior Research will be conducted using hybird Zoom video and web conferencing platform (https://www.zoom.us/) hosted by the National University of Singapore.
      
        <p><b>Log in</b><p>
        Participants should log in to the web conferencing platform 15-minutes before the start of the session. All participants will be required to provide their full name, and can include their institution name in brackets if they would prefer to. Attendees will be encouraged to share their camera; however, those that do not wish may use a profile picture instead. The moderator will be online to assist where necessary.
    
        <p><b>Use of Zoom</b></p>
        Zoom can be used on a PC, Mac, tablet or mobile, where presenters and attendees will be able to communicate using the device microphone with text options available. If you have not used Zoom before, we will provide you with a link to the program. The meeting ID for each day can be found in the information mail sent to you before the event.
        To ensure full functionality, it is recommended that participants download the Zoom app or plug-in where possible (https://zoom.us/download/) . For those unable to download any plugins or software there is a zoom web client allowing one to join from the browser. The web client functions best on Google Chrome however it has limited features. You can enter the meetings at any time to test your connection and install the app and/or plugin in advance of the events.
    
        <p><b>Internet connection</b></p>
        If one participant has a poor connection that is causing issues, the moderator will privately message the participant offering possible solutions. Where necessary moderator will also have the ability to restrict access.
        
        <p><b>Contact</b></p>
        In case of issues faced, please email the co-organiser Chua Yun Xuan (chuayunxuan@nus.edu) who will be online and happy to address your questions.
        
        <p><b>Annex 79 Meeting</b></p>
        The Annex 79 Meeting sessions will be run from a single Zoom meeting, with access provided via a meeting link emailed to registered participants. The subtask meetings will be run in parallel using the ‘Breakout Rooms’ functionality of the Zoom platform. Participants are required to download and install the Zoom app. Participants using Zoom Rooms, Web Client, or Chrome OS client may be required to have additional plugins, please check out <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115005769646">this article</a>. To help the moderator we kindly request attendees to name themselves stating the breakout session number they would like to join during the breakouts, e.g. ’S1 – Chua Yun Xuan, for subtask 1 breakout room.
        
        <p><b>Occupant Behavior Symposium</b></p>
        The Symposium will run from a single meeting (one Zoom link during the entire Symposium). A moderator will be on hand throughout the event to provide support and assistance.
        
        <p><b>Presenters</b></p>
        Presenters are asked to send their presentations a week beforehand to the Symposium organizer, Dr. Clayton Miller (clayton@nus.edu.sg), to be held locally. During the Symposium and Annex meeting, presenters will need to share their presentation on their screen. In case there is a problem, the organizers will use the local versions of the presentation for the meeting.
        Please note that the programme is structured to deliver the presentations within the allocated time slots. Please make sure that you do not go beyond your allotted time. The moderator will be strict with the programme timing.
        
        <p><b>Attendees</b></p>
        Attendees will be muted upon joining the session and will be able to raise questions through the chat function of the platform. By the end of the session, the presenters will have time to answer these. All those that join the meeting will initially join as an attendee and those presenting will be temporarily given presenter permissions (co-host) where they will be able to share their screen. These permissions will be altered between sessions by the moderator in the breaks between the sessions.
